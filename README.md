Setting up my Linux account just the way I like it
============

Things I share between my various computers at home and work. This
contains nothing confidential or no IP of my employer.

To use I do a `git clone` of this repository in my home directory, and
then refer to the files in this directory from my various setup files.

bashrc
----
In the ~/.bashrc file I add
```sh
. $HOME/eobify/bashrc
```
